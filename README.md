# Bushfire-Analysis-using-Meteorological-Data

## About
As we all know, Bushfires are major environmental issues, creating economical and ecological damages. Traditional human surveillance is expensive and inefficient, which can also
be affected by subject factors. So in this project, we are going to build statistical models to:
1. Predict the burned area of a bushfire given the collected data.
2. Identify the main variables responsible for the target variable. ie. Burned area
The dataset that we are going to use in this project is collected from the northeast region of Portugal between January 2000 and December 2003.

## Data Exploration
We use this step to find out the initial observation of the dataset, correlation, and distribution of features.
If the features have different distributions, we do transformations to gain normality.
Done initial feature selection by finding out the correlation between attributes and the target variable.

## Model Development
Creating baseline models for further feature selection. Then using different approaches like step function and subset regression approach to get more clarity of the selected features.

# Model Comparison
We have compared Linear Regression, Random Forest, and SVM with the features that we got from Model Development.

# Variable Identification and Explanation
We have found out the main variables that are responsible for fires with the help of EDA, Baseline Models, and the Subnet Regression Approach.
